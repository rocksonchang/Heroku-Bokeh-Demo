# Python+Bokeh+Flask+Heroku Demo

A demonstration of putting some different things together, towards launching an interactive web application.  The live app can be found here:  http://rc-heroku-bokeh-test.herokuapp.com/index

This test appliction is a sample project proposed by the Data Incubator for their fellows 
http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2015/09/painlessly-deploying-data-apps-with-bokeh-flask-and-heroku/

The demo uses Python to pull stock data from Quandl, and plot this using Bokeh.  All this is wrapped together in Flask to create an interactive web application, and deployed on Heroku.

I used several references to put this together:
